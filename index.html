  <h1>Hi, I'm Connor.</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    I'm a student at Princeton University studying physics, mathematics, computer science, and French. In each of these fields, I have a bit of experience detailed here on the website. You can read more about this

  <p>
    My background can be divided rather cleanly into three categories: research, work, or class.

    <summary><b>SULI DOE and Technical Intern</b> at <i>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</i></summary>
    <p>
      Summer 2019 <br>
      At PNNL, I worked as a member of the Belle II collaboration at PNNL under mentor Jan Strube. My work was primarily involved with better understanding the functioning of the Belle II experiment's TOP detector. In the beginning, this meant working to understand simulated collision events to model the detector's response given different particle types, incident angles and positions, and momenta. The core of my work then moved to developing a novel, data-driven likelihood model for determining the likelihood that an incident particle is of a given particle type. This meant large-scale collection of simulation data and the development of optimized calculation techniques. At the end of my ten-week internship through the Department of Energy's SULI program, my team kept me on as a technical intern for additional month to wrap up my research and write a report for internal review by the Belle II experiment.

    <summary><b>Research Assistant</b> at <i>Purdue University Metastable Fluids Research Laboratory</i></summary>
    <p>
      May 2015 - May 2017 <br>
      At MFRL, I worked primarily on nuclear detection physics. The laboratory specializes in neutron detectors called TMFDs, or Tensioned Metastable Fluid Detectors. These detectors work by putting fluids into a metastable state, in which interaction with a neutron with enough energy would directly cause the liquid to change to gas. My work was primarily with helping to build a spectroscopic model for these detectors, from first physics principles as best as possible. The physics surrounding tensioned fluids is not super well understood, so much of the work required building our model from the ground up. In pursuit of this aim, I
