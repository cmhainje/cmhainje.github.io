I really liked the concept of this book: a scientist's account of contact with something truly alien and the utter failing of humans to make any sense of it. First, *finally* an alien story where the aliens aren't repackaged humans or animals, but something truly *alien*. (*Story of Your Life* by Chiang also comes to mind.) I really liked the 'living ocean' and its completely inscrutable behaviors. Second, Lem uses this concept as a vehicle to consider questions about the philosophy of science and our understanding of our *own* inner workings, which is very interesting and prompted some really deep questions for me. One such question: all of our science has been discovered through a human lens, but is that lens possibly a blinder? Is the true nature of the Universe possible for humans to conceive of? Is it even possible to answer these questions?

I also somewhat enjoyed the fictional accounts of the Solarist science that are sprinkled throughout. I think that they wax on for far too long sometimes, especially since they're very dry and completely peppered with the names of random fictional people who aren't mentioned again and have no backstory. But I sort of get the pointâ€”this is what real science often looks like, and, from this perspective, it's almost comical.

I will say that I really did not like the characters, especially Kelvin and Snow. They behaved *so* bizarrely, and not in a way that I can explain as people being weird because of the weird circumstances. Their dialogue was downright terrible at times, and sometimes they reacted to goings on completely nonsensically. Maybe some of this was a translation issue? Or maybe I just wasn't picking up on some subtext that makes their behavior make sense? 

All in all, the book is a bit dated, the characters are wack, and it can get really dry at times, but I feel like it's all in service of a really neat idea and some very deep philosophical questions. It got me thinking, and I think I'd like to read it again someday.
