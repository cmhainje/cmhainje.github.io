<h1>August 13 - Tuesday</h1>
<p>
  I started writing up my documentation of the blob (what it is, what we found, etc.) on Overleaf. I feel like given the collaborative nature of the document, Overleaf is probably going to be our best bet, even if we are all just using personal non-PNNL accounts. Here's the link to my project: <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/pmvjnsnsmycp">link</a>.

<h2>Fraction direct</h2>
<p>
One of our metrics for understanding the blob as it relates to track geometry has been plotting the fraction of detected photons which were emitted with p_z &lt; 0. A week or two ago, I found that this fraction is high for low z, and low for high z (as we would expect), with a rather smooth gradient between the two extremes. In the range of the blob, however, there is no gradient, but the fraction holds flat at about 0.5. This was before we implemented cleaning cuts, however, so we were a bit concerned that this feature may have been caused by some of the photons that we clean with our cuts.
<br>
To find out, I remade the plot but with our new 10M events' worth of data across the entire bar. Here is the plot:

Compared to before, the gradient is even more extreme from high to low. In fact, it appears that for nearly two-thirds of the bar, we do not detect photons emitted with p_z &lt; 0; only those which reflect off the mirror appear to make it to the PMTs. This is surprising, but some findings that Alex showed in our meeting.

<h3>Time of first photon</h3>
<p>
To see if this is really true (that for 2/3 of the bar, we only get "reflected" photons), Jan suggested I plot the first photon detection time as a function of incident position, as we will then see if there are just no direct photons in that section of the bar.
<br>
I plotted this with five pion datasets (~50,000 events) and obtained this plot:

It's quite rough, with many bins that did not have a track in them. However, we're seeing that there will definitely be some interesting features when this plot is remade with more data.
