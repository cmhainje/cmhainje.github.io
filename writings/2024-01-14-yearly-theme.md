I've been thinking lately about what it means to live well, and I think I've hit on a nice metaphor that clicked some pieces into place for me. So, in this post, I'd like to explain the metaphor and describe how I plan to put it in action in 2024.

## The Garden

> A well-lived life is like a well-tended garden.

The metaphor is that a well-lived life is a lot like a well-tended _garden_. The insight underlying this metaphor is that our lives are made of things that we find meaningful, and these things require regular tending. Further, living well requires understanding how to tend to each thing: how much energy does it require? how frequently? what kind of work do you need to do for it to thrive? This all strikes me as remarkably similar to gardening. A garden contains plants which require regular tending, and the skillful gardener understands what each plant requires to thrive—light levels, watering frequency, soil nutrients, and so on. The skillful gardener also understands which plants work well with one another, and may even have a design for the garden as a whole in mind that they work toward.

I think that reframing life in this way has led me to a few realizations about what living well looks like.

**Not too much.** A garden has finite size, and the best use of that space is _not_ to stuff as much inside as possible. Rather, a beautiful garden chooses judiciously what to include and what to exclude, *even* if that means excluding some beautiful plants. Similarly, life is finite, and a life lived well is *not* a life filled as full as possible. Choose carefully to which things you give your time, and don't try to do too much. This necessarily means turning down things that you may want to do, and that's OK.

**Understand each thing's needs.** Different plants need different care, and each plant has its own optimal amount of each need (water, light, humidity, etc.). Finding these sweet spots is crucial for allowing each plant to thrive, and *not* working at the sweet spot can hurt the plant, even with the gardener's best intentions. Similarly, in life, different things require different amounts of energy, and putting in the optimal amount of energy leads to the best results. Too little energy and things wither away neglected; too much energy can lead to burnout or smothering. Note that, like plants, some things have wide ranges of acceptable care, and some are *very* sensitive. Learning which things are sensitive and which aren't is important to figuring out how to budget your energy, because it shows which balls can be safely dropped from time to time and which absolutely can't.

**Rushing is pointless.** Plants grow at their own pace, and a thriving plant may still take a very long time to reach its full potential. Wishing that a plant would grow faster is useless. The gardener has to accept this. Similarly, many things in life take time to develop. Rushing them is at best a waste of energy, and at worst can choke them out completely. We have to understand that many things simply take the time they take, and be patient.

**Beware of weeds.** In a garden, weeds can seemingly come from nowhere, spread _fast_, and overwhelm the beautiful, delicate plants you are trying to grow. Hence, tending the garden means being vigilant against these threats, quickly pruning them when noticed. Similarly, in life, some things have a tendency to crop up when unwanted or unexpected and to overrun the other beautiful things you are working toward. (In my life, the clearest example is social media.) Being the gardener of your life means being aware of when certain draws on your time seemingly come from nowhere, get out of hand, and snuff out the other things you care more about.

**Work with a design in mind—or don't!** A garden can be built through meticulous planning, design, and execution, but this isn't strictly necessary. A garden can also be built organically, little-by-little, by experimenting and seeing what works well. In either case, the result comes about only after a long while, and requires constant, small adjustments along the way. This works with life, too: having goals or a comprehensive plan can *help* to inform your day-to-day decisions, but it's also perfectly valid to just wing it and see what works. The key is to make sure that we are always moving toward better.

**The daily work should be meaningful, too.** One problem that can come about, *especially* for the planning types like myself, is that we spend our day-to-day thinking and working toward the _future_ state of the garden. We dream about how nice it will be _later_, when the plants have had the time they needed to grow. This strictly future-oriented mindset has two issues. For one, that future may never arrive. Unexpected problems, disaster, or just the mundane can easily derail a complex plan, and this can't derail our entire life. Living well requires adapting to circumstances, and thus being flexible about the future. But the second problem is more insidious: what happens if that future *does* arrive? Living with a strictly future-oriented mindset means that when that future comes about, either...

- you move the goal posts, set a new future to work toward, and don't stop to enjoy the fruits of your labor; or
- you stop to enjoy the results, but struggle, because previously you derived fulfillment from striving toward a goal, but now you don't have one anymore.

Together, these problems indicate to me another outlook that I think is actually more common in gardening, which is that we have to derive meaning and enjoyment from the simple act of spending time in the garden. Meaning can't come *only* from some hoped-for future. Instead, we have to learn to enjoy the garden for what it is *in the present*. (Note: I'm not saying that we can't plan for or look forward to things; rather, I'm saying that we can't *exclusively* do that. We need to also find fulfillment in the day-to-day.)

## Putting it in action

Here's some of the ways that I plan to put this in action in 2024.

Following from the realization that a beautiful garden is not an overcrowded mess (*a.k.a.* I burned myself out in 2023), I'm choosing to do *less*. I'm going to take fewer classes, not be a TA while also taking classes, and try to wrap up research projects so that I can focus better on the ones that will carry forward to my dissertation (and onward).

Similarly, I want to be *more decisive*. Doing less means not taking on as much stuff, but it *also* means learning how to decisively say *no*. This is of the utmost importance as I formally choose my advisor and research topic this spring, but also carries over to my day-to-day. I need to be more decisive about the simple things, too—what to each for lunch, whether to wash my laundry today, which book to read next, etc.—and I think the *source* of this decisiveness should be the realization that *any* choice is far better than no choice at all.

I want to tend to the *body*. I feel like physical health is the foundation on top of which all the meaningful things in life are built, and my foundation has been feeling crumbly. In the garden metaphor, I suppose this would be the soil... or the water quality? Regardless, its importance to *everything else* I care about is obvious, and I've gone on too long without paying it its due.

I also want to tend to the *mind*. The mind, like the body, is an integral component to the entire garden. But where I think of the body as being a physical component of the garden, I think of the mind as being even more fundamental. Everything about the experience of life comes from the *mind*, so its health is like the health of the Sun for the garden: it's the utter bedrock of everything. To care for the mind, I have a few specific ideas.

- Less screen time. Scrolling on social media is the biggest weed in my garden: I don't intentionally choose it, it spreads *fast*, and its overgrowth chokes out the other things I care about. Not to mention that constantly reading about all that's wrong with the world doesn't usually help my emotional state.
- Relatedly, my work on the computer is alienating at times. My mind is *not* a digital machine, and it craves real, physical interaction with the world. (Also, I'm sure screens help drive  my vision issues and headaches). Aside from just spending more time outside, I also want to explore ways to do more of my work *off* the computer and away from the screen.
- Finding better focus. Not from a place of optimizing my productivity, but from a place of wanting to spend my time more intentionally on the things I find meaningful.
- Being more patient. Things take time; sometimes, more time than I expect or want. Accept that this is okay.
- Wandering often. I've come to think of *wandering* as an incredibly important piece of my creativity, mental health, emotional regulation, and my life more generally. I'll probably write up my thoughts on this more completely some other time, but for now it suffices to say that I want to intentionally spend more time being *aimless*. Letting the mind, body, and spirit wander, by taking walks or sitting still with no goal other than to just *be*. Important to wandering is a lack of stimulus aside from your surroundings.

Lastly, I want to tend to my *spirit* by finding what resonates with me. There's two main things going on here. First, following the realization that the garden is finite, I'm choosing *resonance* as the criterion to help me choose which things deserve to take up some of that finite space. In particular, I only want to keep the things which resonate with me most strongly: my relationship, friendships, the work I feel most connected to, etc. The second aspect, though, is the question of what resonates with me in the first place. *Why* do certain things resonate more than others? *What* generates this resonance? These questions are a bit more philosophical, and I think their pursuit will help me understand what gives my life meaning. In pursuit of answers to these questions, I want to explore more art and philosophy in 2024 to find out living well has meant to others, and to see if I can't find what keeps my clock ticking.

So, that's my theme for 2024: the Year of the Garden. Here's hoping this metaphor helps me to live well this year.
