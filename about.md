# About me

Hi, I'm Connor. I'm a fourth-year undergrad at Princeton University majoring in
physics.  I'm also pursuing certificates (minors) in applied math and computer
science.  I am passionate about research, technology, and design, and I find
these fields blend together quite often in my school, my work, and my side
projects.
