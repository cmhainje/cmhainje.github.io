# About

My name is Connor Hainje. I’m a second-year physics PhD student at New York
University, and I study machine learning methods for cosmology and cosmological
simulation. I am originally from Indiana, and I completed my undergraduate
studies in physics at Princeton University in 2021.

I am passionate about uncovering the secrets of our Universe and figuring out
the best ways to use computers to help us in this pursuit. I believe that the
world’s knowledge is only meaningful so far as it is *shared*, so I care a lot
about finding the best ways to present information and teach it to others. To
this end, I find myself super interested in data visualization, typography,
graphic design, and interactive explanations.
