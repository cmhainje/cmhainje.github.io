# about

I am a third-year PhD student in the Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics at NYU. I study dynamics, cosmology, and machine learning, with a particular focus on how these can be used as probes for dark matter. My primary advisor is [David Hogg](https://cosmo.nyu.edu/hogg/), though I regularly work with several others, including Glennys Farrar (NYU) and Mariangela Lisanti (Princeton). My research is funded by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.

I am passionate about uncovering the secrets of our Universe and figuring out
the best ways to use computers to help us in this pursuit. I believe that the
worldâ€™s knowledge is only meaningful so far as it is *shared*, so I care a lot
about finding the best ways to present information and teach it to others. To
this end, I find myself super interested in data visualization, typography,
graphic design, and interactive explanations.
