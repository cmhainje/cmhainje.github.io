    <br><br>
    In the physics department at Princeton, concentrators are required to do an independent research project each semester of their junior year. This is the project I completed for the fall semester.
    <br><br>
    I worked with Professor Herman Verlinde as my advisor. The project was a literature review in which I reviewed the theory relevant to the gravitational waveforms produced during black hole mergers. The paper starts with a brief overview of the general relativity necessary to describe black holes and gravitational waves. It then merges the two to show the waves produced by black hole mergers, and culminates in a discussion of the waveforms of the ringdown phase specifically. This involves a discussion of the theory of quasinormal modes, the importance of overtones in waveform analysis, and methods for parameter recovery.
    <br><br>
    This project is chiefly important because it serves as my first foray into astrophysics. Over the past few semesters, I've become increasingly interested in diversifying my research a bit and beginning to do something on a "larger" scale, given that most of my background has been with nuclear and particle physics. This project, then, represented the beginning of an endeavor to do just that, and I found the whole experience greatly enjoyable. I really liked what general relativity I learned, as well as the physics I picked up to describe black holes and gravitational waves. On the whole, it was a fun project, and I'd love to more in the same vein in the future.
