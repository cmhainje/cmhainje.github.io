Time for my third monthly blog post! I missed August, but I don't want to give up on this, so we'll just carry on as though I hadn't.

## Recently

I've been in NYC for a little over a month now and I've really settled into my routine. Brooklyn is really nice. Days locked in my bedroom staring at Jupyter notebooks... maybe not so much. But we're still getting good work done and I've got new projects on the horizon. Exciting.

Lately, I've been watching a lot of shows and moveis and reading some as well. Here's some of my recs.
- _Ted Lasso_ is fantastic
- I quite enjoyed _The Flight Attendant_
- _Gone Girl_ is a great movie
- The book _Dune_ was great, too

## Upcoming

Coming up, I'm looking forward to starting my grad school applications, working on some new projects at PNNL, and scheduling semi-regular meet-ups with my friends in Princeton. Should be fun.
