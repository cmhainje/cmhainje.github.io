  <h1>This website</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    This website is the most up-to-date example of my front-end development skills. Over time, I plan to continue updating this website to implement new things I'm learning, like CSS animation or simple Javascript programs.
    <br><br>
    I built this website 100% by hand, using raw HTML and CSS alone. (Well, not quite. I prefer to write my CSS in Sass, but that's really not that far from raw CSS anyway.) I have used Bootstrap before (see my <a href="hhs.html">Hainje Home Solutions website project</a>), but I wanted to see what I could do without any help from pre-existing frameworks. As such, all elements of the theme, like fonts and spacing, were intentional decisions made by me. Over time, I'm planning on making the website more scalable to mobile devices. This is certainly more difficult without Bootstrap, but I like to consider it a challenge to help build my web development skills.

  <h4>Design philosophy</h4>
  <p>
    My design philosophy for this website (and honestly for nearly everything) is to keep it as simple as possible. To help keep myself to this, I decided on a few basic rules to follow. The fewest number of fonts and colors should be used. Emphasis should be denoted by bold-faced font, and single horizontal lines should be used as separators. To help spice it up, I decided to alternate light and dark chunks, which you can see most easily on the home page. Even that, though, helps to group related content together and make the distinctions easily visible, so its function is more than just aesthetic.
    <br><br>
    Regarding the font, I decided to use Helvetica Neue because it is such a simple font. Helvetica is famous and iconic for its utter ubiquity, and Helvetica Neue is the same font but with some slight tweaks that make it, at least in my eyes, a little prettier. In fact, I truly believe it is one of the best fonts ever created, and I think many other major companies who use it, like Twitter and the New York MTA, would agree.
    <br><br>
    I chose the black-and-white theme in part because I love the stark contrast of the two, and in part because I couldn't decide on an actual color to throw into the mix. The contrast one achieves by using black and white is literally greater than the contrast of any other color combination, making it ridiculously easy to read. The lack of color, however, also fits into the minimalist design philosophy I decided to employ on this page. Fewer colors means fewer distractions, and the focus of the website is on its content. This is, by all means, an intentional design choice.
  </p>
  <h4>Technical elements</h4>
  <p>
    Honestly, there aren't many. All the HTML was written by hand, and the CSS was written in Sass (also by hand). I maintain the code in a GitHub repository, and then deploy the website to the public with GitHub Pages.
