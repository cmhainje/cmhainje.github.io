    This was my very first project with web development, in the summer of 2017 before my freshman year of college. The task was to build a website for my dad's business. Rather than just go to a website builder, though, I wanted to use this as an opportunity to learn some front-end web development. Plus, since it was for his business, my dad was willing to throw a little money my way, so I was literally getting paid to learn new coding stuff. Cool!
    <br><br>
    To start, I read through some basic w3schools tutorials for working with HTML and Bootstrap, as well as the Bootstrap documentation. Then, I set to work, and over the course of a few weeks, I put together a website. It was rough and a bit buggy and it definitely didn't scale well, but it worked and I was proud of it. A few weeks later, I came back to it and gave it a bit of an overhaul, changing fonts and colors and fixing some of the bugs.
    <br><br>
    Since then, though, I haven't done much with it. I know now that my approach with the website was a bit less-than-stellar, given how horribly unoptimized the Services page is (I should have used lower quality, compressed images to save load time) and the fact that there is always a little bit of left-right scrolling possible (a bit of an issue with Bootstrap container-fluid and container div's). One day, I'll go back and update it, but for now it stands as a reminder of how far I've come.
