  <h1>Portfolio</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    Here, I've consolidated pretty much all of my work, complete with short descriptions and links to PDFs, posters, etc. (when possible). Check it out below.
    <br><br>
    Please note that not all of the links are active at this time. I'm currently working on uploading all of these projects and writing descriptions for them; if there's one in particular that you want to see, reach out to me and I'll bump it to the top of the priority list.

  <h4>Web development</h4>
  <p>
    Most of my projects have been in front-end design; check them out here.
    <br><br>
    <a href="portfolio/website.html">This website</a>
    <br>
    The website you are currently on! Built in pure HTML and CSS, 100% by me.
    <br><br>
    <a href="portfolio/hhs.html">Hainje Home Solutions</a>
    <br>
    My first foray into web design. This is the website for my dad's business, built in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

  <h4>Class projects</h4>
  <p>
    I think that some of the programming projects I've completed for classes are worth sharing here.
    <br><br>
    <a href="portfolio/tweetgan.html">TweetGAN</a>
    <br>
    The final project for COS 484: Natural Language Processing. Along with my partner Kathryn Leung, I used SeqGAN to generate Tweets.
    <br><br>
    <a href="bad.html">"ISH" shell</a>
    <br>
    For the final programming assignment for COS 217: Introduction to Programming Systems, I built a functioning terminal shell.
    <br><br>
    <a href="bad.html">Seam carver</a>
    <br>
    Implementing this elegant photo-resizing algorithm was a programming assignment I completed with my partner Kathryn Leung for COS 226: Data Structures and Algorithms. It resizes photos by removing "seams" of least energy from the photo, preserving high-energy regions of the photos corresponding to important features, like faces.

  <h4>Independent Work</h4>
  <p>
    My independent research projects completed with faculty at Princeton.
