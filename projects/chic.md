[chic](https://github.com/cmhainje/chic) is my work-in-progress personal
matplotlib style. it's a Python package that sets all my preferred matplotlib
defaults on import, and also includes a number of additional colorschemes and a
few plotting utilities that I find myself using often.

I built this in part because I'm never quite sure whether the colorschemes I
use with matplotlib will be colorblind-safe. to that end, I'm aggregating many
of the colorblind-friendly colorschemes that are around on the Internet. I've
only just started this by including all of [Paul Tol's
colorschemes](https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/), but I'll keep adding them as I
find them!
