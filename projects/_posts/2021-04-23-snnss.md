For my senior year, I wanted to get the certificate in the [Program in Applied &
Computational Mathematics][pacm] (PACM), which involves taking a few extra math
and physics classes and completing an independent research project. For my
research, then, I worked with Prof. [Adam Burrows][burrows] of the astrophysics
department to build a numerical solver that implements a Kompaneets formalism
which describes the impacts of neutrino-nucleon inelastic scattering on the
distribution of neutrinos in core-collapse supernovae. This research involved
first implementing a working solver for the ordinary differential equations that
describe the formalism, then looking closely at a variety of methods for
interpolating, differentiating, and integrating over a discretely-sampled
spectrum.
