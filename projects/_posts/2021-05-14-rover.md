For the final project of my computer graphics course ([COS 426][cos]), I used
Three.js to build a game where you can play as a rover exploring Mars. It's not
a very sophisticated game, but I'm quite proud of what I was able to accomplish
in ~10 days with pretty much no prior experience building a game from the ground
up.

You can find the game [here][rov].
