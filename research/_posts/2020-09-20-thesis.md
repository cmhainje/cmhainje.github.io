I am currently working on this. Check out my work in [its repository][repo].
Note that it's still very early in its lifespan: check back later (or next
year!) for updates.

I am working with Prof. Mariangela Lisanti of the Princeton Department of
Physics on a project to explore the impacts of different dark matter models on
the formation and evolution of the Sagittarius stream. This involves 
- knowledge of several dark matter models, including cold dark matter (CDM) and
  self-interacting dark matter (SIDM),
- effective usage of *N*-body simulation tools like GADGET-2 and GIZMO,
- proficiency in the usage of the Linux command-line and the SLURM job queue,
- fluency in Python and data analysis methods.
