      I am a first-year physics PhD student at New York University, where I study dark matter phenomenology in the <a href="https://cosmo.nyu.edu/">Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics</a>. I recently graduated (May 2021) with a Bachelor's degree in physics from Princeton University, where I also completed certificates in <a href="https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/">Applied & Computational Mathematics</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/ugrad/overview">Applications of Computing</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I have tutored students in some form or other since I was in high school myself (six years!), mostly in math and physics. Through my junior and senior years of high school, I volunteered to tutor other high school students in math (Algebra I and II, Geometry, Precalculus, and Calculus I). During undergrad, I was a volunteer cello teacher for two years. I also worked for five semesters as a grader for <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring21/cos226/">COS 226</a> (Data Structures and Algorithms); for this work, I won a student teaching award in my senior year. Since undergrad, I've been tutoring students in Algebra and Geometry.

      On top of being very familiar with higher level math and science, I also went through the AP exam wringer not too long ago, earning 5's in AP Statistics (2015), Calculus AB (2016), Chemistry (2017), Biology (2017), Physics 1 (2017), so I know well how to prepare for these exams.
