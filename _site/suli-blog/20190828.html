<h1>Aug 28 - Wednesday</h1>

<p>
  Today's hours were spent backfilling log posts a little bit and putting together a new presentation for the Belle II TOP group. The presentation is fairly solidly laid out; what remains is to add plots and to clean up the text a bit in some areas. There are also a few placeholder slides still that need to be filled out, but overall I'm rather pleased. Tomorrow, I'll work on finishing up the slides. I'll need to make a list of the necessary plots to make/remake/obtain and then work on getting those. I want to be sure that all of my figures have good, consistent axis labels and titles, color schemes, etc. and are all made from the most recent data that we have.
