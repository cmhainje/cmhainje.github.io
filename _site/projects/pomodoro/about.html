        <h1>Introducing Pomodoro</h1>
        <p><i>Summer 2019</i></p>
        <p>Here is the project: <a href="/pomodoro/index.html">link</a>.</p>

<p>Pomodoro is a simple Pomodoro timer that I built to help me manage my time more
effectively at <a href="/research//2019/09/15/belle2.html">my internship</a> this summer.
It is a productivity method designed to help minimize mental distractions due to
burnout by building many short breaks into the workday. Each of these breaks
helps the mind to reset itself. Further, each work period is only 25 minutes
long, so even when you’re tired, it’s relatively easy to push yourself to work
toward the next break.</p>

<p>I found this method very helpful, and even saw that my productivity improved.
While on a typical day I would start feeling really burnt out around 3:00pm, I
found that I would be able to work all the way until leaving without feeling
exhausted (and with less eye strain!).</p>
