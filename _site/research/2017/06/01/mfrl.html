        <p><i>Summer 2015 - Summer 2017</i></p>
        <p>In high school, I worked as a research assistant at the Purdue University
Metastable Fluid Research Laboratory (MFRL), a lab that works primarily on
nuclear detection physics. The laboratory specializes in neutron detectors
called TMFDs, or Tensioned Metastable Fluid Detectors. These detectors work by
putting fluids into a metastable state, in which interaction with a neutron with
enough energy would directly cause the liquid to change to gas. My work was
primarily with helping to build a spectroscopic model for these detectors, from
first physics principles as best as possible. The physics surrounding tensioned
fluids is not super well understood, so much of the work required building our
model from the ground up. In pursuit of this aim, I</p>

<ul>
  <li>Helped to develop a model for spectroscopy methods</li>
  <li>Wrote MCNP decks for nuclear simulation to refine our model</li>
  <li>Designed and constructed an experimental apparatus, by</li>
  <li>Designing and constructing constant-temperature chamber</li>
  <li>Programming an Arduino microcontroller for temperature regulation</li>
  <li>Performed precise scientific experimentation</li>
  <li>Wrote analysis scripts to test our model with MCNP output as well as
experimental data</li>
