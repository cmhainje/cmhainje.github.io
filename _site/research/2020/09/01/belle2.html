        <h1>Belle II, Round II</h1>
        <p><i>Summer 2020</i></p>
        <p>For the second summer in a row, I’m working with Jan Strube at PNNL on the Belle
II experiment. While I’m still working primarily on the TOP subdetector, my work
is quite a bit more focused on how we can use machine learning to aid in our
analysis.</p>

<p>So far, most of my work has gone into understanding on a deeper level the
particle identification (PID) system employed by the TOP. As Belle II continues
to run and take data, it has become increasingly evident that there are somewhat
strong discrepancies between simulation and data; namely, the data is not
performing nearly as well as expected from simulation. Understanding why this is
the case is paramount to increasing the quality of data recorded at Belle II.</p>

<p>The TOP detector works as particle passing through emit photons (called
Cherenkov radiation) which are internally reflected through the detector until
they are absorbed and recorded by an array of photomultipliers (PMTs). This set
of photon detections (each of which consists of a time and PMT channel) are
theoretically sufficient to identify the passing particles, especially when
combined with track information that can be obtained from the particle’s
reconstructed track (information like momentum). My goal for the first part of
this internship has been to develop methods for understanding each photon’s
contribution to the TOP likelihoods for PID. This has been largely performed by
creating additional C++ and Fortran methods in the Belle II analysis software
framework, as well as by creating a new C++ data object type that can be used by
Python analysis scripts.</p>

<p>With this work in place, it is now possible to retrieve the likelihoods on a
pixel-by-pixel basis. This allows us to understand whether patterns exist in the
contributions of photons to the likelihoods (for instance, whether early photons
are more important than late ones, or whether certain PMT channels matter more
or less). This is currently a bit of a work-in-progress, so we shall see if any
interesting results come about.</p>

<p>The other primary part of my work is machine learning. In particular, I’m
working on machine learning for particle identification: developing a model
which, given a particle’s associated photon detections and track parameters,
classifies the particle type. This is an interesting problem because the form of
the data does not quite match that of pre-existing models. Further, it is rather
easy to show that a problem like this is solvable for a given set of track
parameters, but varying track parameters over the whole of their phase space
(which is rather large) poses the challenge of scalability. Again, this is a bit
of a work-in-progress, so check back later for potential updates.</p>
