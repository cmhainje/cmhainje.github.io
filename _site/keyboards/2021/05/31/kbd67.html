    <p>I recently (about a month and a half ago) purchased and built my first custom
mechanical keyboard. It is a <a href="https://kbdfans.com/products/kbd67lite">KBD67 Lite R1</a> from KBDFans, with <a href="https://www.ashkeebs.com/product/gazzew-u4-boba-switches/">Gazzew
Boba U4</a> (silent) switches and the <a href="https://novelkeys.xyz/collections/keycaps/products/pbt-notion">PBT Notion</a> keycaps from
<a href="https://twitter.com/biipmk">biip</a>. I have now been using it for a lot of my typing and programming
in the time since (and there has been a <em>lot</em> of typing in that time), so I
thought I would take a little time to go over some of my thoughts on this
board.</p>

<h2 id="specs">Specs</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Case: ABS plastic, white color</li>
  <li>Plate: polycarbonate</li>
  <li>PCB: same as the KBD67 MKII
    <ul>
      <li>Kailh hot-swap switches</li>
      <li>USB-C connector</li>
      <li>Per-key RGB</li>
      <li>VIA compatible</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Stabilizers: Cherry screw-in</li>
  <li>Switches: Boba U4 (silent)</li>
  <li>Keycaps: PBT Notion</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>

<p>All in all, I think I really like this keyboard. As it is my first custom
mechanical keyboard, I don’t exactly have a lot to compare it against. I can
instead comment on the features of this board in particular that I like.</p>

<p>The sound is actually quite muted and low in pitch, both of which are really
appealing to me. I think that a lot of that, however, has to do with the
switches I chose, which are meant to be silent and strongly-tactile. I feel like
the switches are a bit scratchy, though; something that would probably be fixed
by lubing them. I will comment, though, that these switches took a little while
to break in; in the beginning, I had some pretty significant issues with keys
sending double-presses and with the switches struggling to return from a
depressed state. Nowadays, I don’t have much of an issue with those things at
all. I do find, however, that the switches feel just a little heavy to me, and
my hands do get a bit tired if I’m typing a lot on it. Maybe switches with a
weaker tactile bump, or maybe even linears, would alleviate that problem. (I
know it’s never been an issue on my old Ducky keyboard running MX Browns…)</p>

<p>In terms of the look of the board, I think this is fantastic. I am quite a fan
of white on my tech, so the white case and white keycaps with a few splashes of
color is really nice. I have also really enjoyed the customizability that I’ve
been able to take advantage of with VIA. I haven’t done a lot with it, but it
has been super easy and convenient.</p>

<p>I also really appreciated that the board came mostly pre-assembled from KBDFans,
albeit lacking switches and keycaps. Combining that with a hot-swap PCB meant
that the build process was really painless and easy for a total beginner like
myself. I definitely think I would recommend the KBD67 Lite to newcomers to the
mechanical keyboard hobby, though I’m not sure I would recommend the Bobas. All
in all, though, I’m quite happy with this one.</p>
