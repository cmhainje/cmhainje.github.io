title: Making this blog
---

In an effort to aid in reproducibility and help future me understand what I did
here, I've decided to write a little about the way that I made this blog. I used
[Jekyll][jk], a static-site generator that I've used a little in the past, and
[GitHub Pages][gp]. Regarding the formatting, I decided to use Rasmus
Andersson's [Inter][in] for the font and his [Raster][rs] for the layout. I
discovered Inter a little bit ago, and I think that it is really a fantastic
font for reading things on the web. Raster probably wasn't necessary, but it
makes it quick and easy to make a grid in HTML, _and_ Rasmus included Inter
imports and nice default sizes and weights in the full Raster package.
