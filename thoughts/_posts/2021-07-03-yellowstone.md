description: photos from my trip

I just got back from my trip to Yellowstone with Kathryn's family. Here are some
of my favorite photos.

This was my view from the airport. (The plane in the picture is actually the
plane I had just deboarded.)

On our first day, we went exploring around the Mammoth Hot Springs.

This was the Yellowstone river, pictured from our cottage in Gardiner.

We hiked the trail to the Lost Lake.

Some more hot springs we saw while driving.

This bison (and a friend trailing behind) stopped us on the road for about
fifteen minutes.

Later on the same day, this pack had traffic backed up pretty substantially. We
were the first cars to have to stop as they were crossing the road. I'd estimate
somewhere around 100-200 bison in total were there, spanning both sides of the
road. Lots of babies were there, too.

This is the Dragon's Mouth Spring.

These pictures are of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.

The Roosevelt Arch, dedicated to President Teddy Roosevelt.

This was in an area with some cool hot springs. I don't know if it has a name,
but I thought it was a really pretty and interesting color.

A pretty river we stopped at for a while to skip rocks.

Of course, we went to see Old Faithful. Here's a shot of it erupting while some
bison decided to come grazing up near the observation area. You can see the Park
Ranger trying to keep people from getting to close to them.

Above are the Grand Prismatic Spring and the Excelsior Geyser Crater. Here's
where the Excelsior lets off into a nearby river.

This is the Excelsior Geyser Crater.

And these pictures show the Grand Prismatic Spring. (The selfie was taken from
next to the spring; the other picture was taken from an overlook we hiked to
later in the day.)

On our last day, we went riding ATVs. This was honestly one of my favorite
non-hiking activities.
