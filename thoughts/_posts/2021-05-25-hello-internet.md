title: Hello, Internet

Hello, Internet. I'm Connor. Over the past few years, I've been getting excited
about making things. I've done a few different personal projects now and I'm
really starting to feel serious about having a nice online presence. Hence, this
blog.

Largely, I intend for this blog to be a place for me to write things, share my
projects, and put up anything else I feel like sharing. I've tried at various
points over the past few years to make a website that I can be proud of, but
I never really felt happy with the results. Now that I've graduated from
undergrad, I think it's time to really get serious about it and make something
with a bit more permanence: that's what this is supposed to be!
