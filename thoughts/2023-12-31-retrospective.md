As 2023 comes to a close, I wanted to take some time to reflect.

During the past year, I entered the second year of my Ph.D. program. I received my first publication in a journal as a first author. I taught a course for the first time. I read more books than in probably any other year of my life. I watched a ton of films. I took hard classes and learned a lot. And unfortunately, I did most of this to the detriment of my health.

I dubbed 2023 the "Year of Ambition", and used that theme to guide my decision-making. I wanted to try new things, be productive, learn a lot, and get stuff done. On those charges, I think I succeeded. However, since the theme of my year was *ambition*, I hesitated too much to say 'no' to anything. I took on too many obligations, and I let some balls drop that I wish I hadn't. I learned my limits, unfortunately by hitting them repeatedly and hard.

## Specifics

**Learning**: I feel like did a great job at *learning* ambitiously. I did great work in my classes this year, and I worked really hard to make sure that everything made sense and fit together in my brain. I feel in top form as a physics student and I feel really primed to start applying what I've learned. In particular, I'm really glad to have taken QFT at a high level and finally have taken general relativity. These classes were very advanced and rewarding, and I'm hoping to find ways to use these in my research.

**Teaching**: Teaching is something I hope to take with me into the future, and I think I did a great job of starting down this path in 2023. I was a TA for the first time: creating and grading homeworks, holding office hours, and teaching my own class section. I learned *so much* from this experience: how to manage my public speaking nerves, how to prepare a lecture, how to respond to questions. I also worked with and helped my classmates often with various homeworks, which sometimes took the form of impromptu lectures, and I think this really sharpened my teaching skills as well. *And*, I got my first taste of preparing pedagogical materials with my homework solutions and 'separability' notes, which I found *ridiculously* fun and which I really want to spend more time doing.

**Research**: This year saw a few bursts of real progress in my research, but I think I'd rate my performance over the year as fairly mixed. While I *did* make a few good bits of progress, almost all of it was during the last six weeks of the summer. I did basically no research during the semesters, and I really failed at developing any kind of research routine. Still, 2023 saw my first official publication as first author, and fairly important breakthroughs in two other projects, so I think I'm poised for 2024 to be a far more successful year in research.

**Reading**: I think leisure reading (both fiction and non-) is important for flexing the mind, and I'm proud of the strides I took to make reading more important this year. Between bookclub and my personal books, I read a lot, and I feel like it's already diversifying my thinking and helping me to approach my life and research from new perspectives. As I build a stronger reading habit, I'm hoping to do a decent job of logging books and taking down notes of things to remember.

**Health**: This was probably the single biggest failure of the year. I really did not prioritize my health correctly; it always came second to any other considerations. I did regularly get enough sleep, and at times maintained a nice walking routine. My diet could be improved, but I think it already got a bit better over the course of this year. Really, though, I failed to get enough exercise, take care of my vision, or address my increasingly severe headaches. Especially in the fall semester, my vision and headaches became a serious obstacle to my learning and work, which defeated the point of prioritizing the work over those things in the first place.

## Changes

While a more detailed discussion of my goals for 2024 will come in a separate post, the above discussion is enough to identify some key changes I need to make.

1. **Doing less.** I always feel like I should be doing more, even when I *also* feel like I'm doing too much. Next year, I want to confront this by intentionally doing *less* and accepting it, and resisting the temptation to do more (which I know I'll inevitably feel).
2. **Prioritizing health.** This one's pretty self-explanatory, especially after the failings I described above, but I need to focus more explicitly on taking care of my bodyâ€”head, eyes, muscles.
3. **Being decisive.** This is really related to #1 in that doing *less* means turning more things down, even things that I'm excited by. The Year of Ambition became so overwhelming in large part because of my indecision: why make a choice if you could instead just try to do both? But, I only have so much time on this Earth, and I'd rather not spend all of it feverishly working and mildly hating my work and life because of it. This is also of special importance this year because I have to formally choose an advisor and research topic this spring, and I had *better* approach this decisively.

These, along with several other goals I've developed that are less related to my 2023 successes/failures, helped me to shape my 2024 theme, which I'll write soon.
