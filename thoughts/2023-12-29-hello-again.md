It's nearly 2024, so naturally my personal website was due its annual refresh. This time around, I wanted to make a clean break and restart.

One somewhat silly reason was to change the tech stack. This doesn't necessitate a total restart, but it's certainly easier this way. I used Jekyll for a long while, but I really wanted to switch to [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). I've used it for a number of smaller projects and had good experiences with it. Also, I don't know Ruby and never cared to learn it, but I *do* know Javascript, which makes it much easier to extend Eleventy with custom functionality when I need.

The biggest reason, though, is because I didn't really like the shape that the site had before. I barely wrote anything, I wasn't particularly proud of anything that was there, and everything felt purposeless. I wanted a clean break, a new start, and the chance to choose a new purpose for my home on the Internet. So what is the purpose of a blog? a home on the Internet? Why bother writing anything?

One reason I think that having a place to publish things online is worthwhile is that writing is a tool for thinking. By writing something down, you have to make precise *exactly* what your ideas are, which makes you think far more critically about them.  Often, an idea can seem crystal clear in your head, but when you go to write it down, you realize it wasn't all that clear, and you need to think harder to pin it down; this is that in action. Also, writing forces you to spend more time with your idea (especially if you're writing longhand!). The more time you spend with an idea at the top of your mind, the more you're turning it over in your brain, searching for rough spots to smooth out or hidden cracks to fill in. It can also be meditative: writing can be your ritual for thinking deeply.

All that's well and good, but could easily be done without a blog. (How about a journal? or just some loose sheets of paper?) I think the advantage of publishing these thoughts *on the web* is that they're public, so there's a natural pressure to try even harder to make sure that the ideas are well-expressed. *And*, by working in public, I feel like I'm holding up the other end of an ancient bargain: writing was developed as a technology to make it possible for people to accurately transmit their ideas to other people. By writing in public, I'm transmitting my ideas and knowledge to the world; maybe someone will respond to my writings, or maybe someone could even learn something. That possibility alone is worth pursuing.

On top of the benefits of writing, I have a fairly frequent itch to play with graphic and typographic design, and HTML/CSS are my favorite tools for the job. Having a website that I care about means having a permanent playpen to scratch that itch. It also gives me a space in which to learn more about design, which feeds back into the desire to transmit knowledge effectively, since our ability to learn anything from a text has a lot to do with its *design*.

All told, I'm excited to use this website as a tool for thinking more deeply and also as a creative outlet.

So, hello again, Internet. Let's be friends.
